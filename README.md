PaLLi – An LLM Discord Bot with Boundaries

**PaLLi** is (currently) a Discord-based assistant powered by a large language model. It’s lightweight, fast, and most importantly—it knows when to *stay quiet*.

Note that this is a **Public Beta Test**

## ✨ Why PaLLi?

PaLLi is *not* a basic command bot. It behaves more like a thoughtful observer than a chatbot on auto-pilot. Its goal is to feel like a smart participant—not just a message responder.

> *“Most bots don’t know when to shut up. PaLLi does.”*
