# PaLLi – Experimental Public Beta

Welcome to the experimental public beta of **PaLLi**, an AI assistant designed for use on Discord.
PaLLi is built to be **selectively responsive, context-aware**, and conversational. It’s designed to engage when it makes sense, stay quiet when it doesn’t, and generally try not to be annoying (we make no promises).

---

## 🚀 Join the Beta
You can try PaLLi right now by joining the Discord server:
👉 **[Join the Beta on Discord]([https://discord.gg/pFhpgHsK])** 👈
Come poke at it, break things, and tell us what exploded.

## 🧠 What It Can Do
- Respond to messages intelligently when appropriate  
- Respect channel settings like mention-only mode  
- Provide helpful replies using recent conversation context  
- Offer limited customization in DMs for more personal interaction  

🛑 **Heads-up:** PaLLi **does not process images, GIFs, or file attachments reliably.** If you upload a cursed PNG and it stares back at you silently, that’s expected.
If it seems like it’s ignoring you, don’t take it personally — it’s just trying to be polite.

---

## 💡 Available Commands
You can manage PaLLi’s behavior with a few simple slash commands:
- `/status` – See current settings in this channel  
- `/toggle_analysis` – Enable or disable message analysis  
- `/toggle_decisions` – Enable or disable smart response filtering  
- `/toggle_mention` – Require @mention to respond in a channel  
- `/show_system_prompt` – View the current guidance PaLLi follows  
- `/set_system_prompt`, `/clear_system_prompt` – Customize in DMs  
- `/reset_message_history` – Clear your DM conversation history  

*Some commands may only be available in DMs or to moderators. Please don’t try to socially engineer the bot. It’s smarter than it looks.*

## 📣 Feedback & Bug Reports
This is a **public beta**, and things may not always work as expected. Actually, they probably won’t. That’s part of the fun.
If you encounter bugs, odd behavior, or want to suggest features, drop your thoughts in the Discord server. Please keep feedback respectful — constructive chaos is welcome, unconstructive chaos... not so much.

---

## 🔐 Data & Privacy
PaLLi temporarily stores recent messages to help generate relevant replies. Messages may be processed by third-party AI services to generate responses, but are not reused by this project beyond the current conversation context.
You can clear your history at any time using:

- `/reset_message_history` (in DMs)

We aim to be transparent and respectful of user data at all times. Also, we don’t want your secret pizza recipes. Probably.

Thanks for testing PaLLi. Your input helps guide its development, squash bugs, and helps us build what it will eventually become ;)
